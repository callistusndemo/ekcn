I learn best by attempting to explain what I’ve understood in writing, and this is a space to do just that.\nI grew up in a culture where food was mostly for nourishment, with the occasional special dish to celebrate. Living in NYC, a world of different cultures has opened up to me, and I get to explore them through food. This is an opportunity to explore my city by visiting different neighborhoods and learning about their cultures through food.\nEarlier this year, my partner (E) and I visited Japan, and I was amazed by the variety of meals that could be created from humble ingredients: rice, eggs, fish, noodles. The blog’s name comes from the first dish we had there, and it remains one of my favorite food memories. E is an excellent cook, and it\u0026rsquo;s a great opportunity to learn from her and spend more time doing something we both love. This will be a joint collaboration with me as the apprentice.\nI am a beginner, the favicon for this site is a nod to that. An acknowledgement that it will take time and hard work to close the gap between my aspirations and my current ability. As Ira Glass puts it:\nif you are just starting out or if you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you’re going to finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you’re going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you’re making will be as good as your ambitions. Cheers, C\n","date":"5 January 2025","permalink":"//localhost:1313/hello-world/","section":"","summary":"Intro note from C.","title":"Hello, World!"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/tags/personal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personal"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/notes/","section":"Journal","summary":"","title":"Journal"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
